The first activity uses\\\\nthe phone\\'s three-dimensional sensors to determine the vector components and\\\\norientation of the background magnetic field at the students\\' locations. The\\\\nresulting vector magnetic field is compared to the expected Earth\\'s magnetic\\\\nfield for their location. The second experiment uses the phone sensors to\\\\nmeasure the magnet field produced by the small magnet found in the speaker of\\\\ncommon earbuds, or in-ear headphones. The students then carefully investigate\\\\nthe dependence of the magnitude of the field on the axial distance between the\\\\nspeaker magnet and the phone\\'s sensors.

The advancements in sensor technology along\\\\nwith recent achievements in machine-learning--based signal-processing\\\\nalgorithms have enabled the development of dietary monitoring solutions that\\\\nyield highly accurate results. A common bottleneck for developing and training\\\\nmachine learning algorithms is obtaining labeled data for training supervised\\\\nalgorithms, and in particular ground truth annotations. Manual ground truth\\\\nannotation is laborious, cumbersome, can sometimes introduce errors, and is\\\\nsometimes impossible in free-living data collection. As a result, there is a\\\\nneed to decrease the labeled data required for training. Additionally,\\\\nunlabeled data, gathered in-the-wild from existing wearables (such as Bluetooth\\\\nearbuds) can be used to train and fine-tune eating-detection models. In this\\\\nwork, we focus on training a feature extractor for audio signals captured by an\\\\nin-ear microphone for the task of eating detection in a self-supervised way. We\\\\nbase our approach on the SimCLR method for image classification, proposed by\\\\nChen et al. from the domain of computer vision.

To solve this problem outside the acoustic domain, we focus on\\\\nhead-wearable devices, such as earbuds and virtual reality (VR) headsets, which\\\\nare feasible to continuously monitor the bone-conducted voice in the vibration\\\\ndomain. Specifically, we identify that air and bone conduction (AC/BC) from the\\\\nsame vocalization are coupled (or concurrent) and user-level unique, which\\\\nmakes them suitable behavior and biometric factors for multi-factor\\\\nauthentication (MFA). The legitimate user can defeat acoustic domain and even\\\\ncross-domain spoofing samples with the proposed two-stage AirBone\\\\nauthentication. The first stage answers \\\\\\\\textit{whether air and bone conduction\\\\nutterances are time domain consistent (TC)} and the second stage runs\\\\n\\\\\\\\textit{bone conduction speaker recognition (BC-SR)}. The security level is\\\\nhence increased for two reasons: (1) current acoustic attacks on smart voice\\\\nassistants cannot affect bone conduction, which is in the vibration domain; (2)\\\\neven for advanced cross-domain attacks, the unique bone conduction features can\\\\ndetect adversary\\'s impersonation and machine-induced vibration. Finally,\\\\nAirBone authentication has good usability (the same level as voice\\\\nauthentication) compared with traditional MFA and those specially designed to\\\\nenhance smart voice security. Our experimental results show that the proposed\\\\nAirBone authentication is usable and secure, and can be easily equipped by\\\\ncommercial off-the-shelf head wearables with good user experience.\", \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15203v1\\'}]', call_id='', is_error=False)]\n",

The second experiment uses the phone sensors to\\nmeasure the magnet field produced by the small magnet found in the speaker of\\ncommon earbuds, or in-ear headphones. The students then carefully investigate\\nthe dependence of the magnitude of the field on the axial distance between the\\nspeaker magnet and the phone's sensors.

To solve this problem outside the acoustic domain, we focus on\\nhead-wearable devices, such as earbuds and virtual reality (VR) headsets, which\\nare feasible to continuously monitor the bone-conducted voice in the vibration\\ndomain. Specifically, we identify that air and bone conduction (AC/BC) from the\\nsame vocalization are coupled (or concurrent) and user-level unique, which\\nmakes them suitable behavior and biometric factors for multi-factor\\nauthentication (MFA). The legitimate user can defeat acoustic domain and even\\ncross-domain spoofing samples with the proposed two-stage AirBone\\nauthentication. The first stage answers \\\\textit{whether air and bone conduction\\nutterances are time domain consistent (TC)} and the second stage runs\\n\\\\textit{bone conduction speaker recognition (BC-SR)}. The security level is\\nhence increased for two reasons: (1) current acoustic attacks on smart voice\\nassistants cannot affect bone conduction, which is in the vibration domain; (2)\\neven for advanced cross-domain attacks, the unique bone conduction features can\\ndetect adversary's impersonation and machine-induced vibration. Finally,\\nAirBone authentication has good usability (the same level as voice\\nauthentication) compared with traditional MFA and those specially designed to\\nenhance smart voice security.

The advancements in sensor technology along\\\\nwith recent achievements in machine-learning--based signal-processing\\\\nalgorithms have enabled the development of dietary monitoring solutions that\\\\nyield highly accurate results. A common bottleneck for developing and training\\\\nmachine learning algorithms is obtaining labeled data for training supervised\\\\nalgorithms, and in particular ground truth annotations. Manual ground truth\\\\nannotation is laborious, cumbersome, can sometimes introduce errors, and is\\\\nsometimes impossible in free-living data collection. As a result, there is a\\\\nneed to decrease the labeled data required for training. Additionally,\\\\nunlabeled data, gathered in-the-wild from existing wearables (such as Bluetooth\\\\nearbuds) can be used to train and fine-tune eating-detection models. In this\\\\nwork, we focus on training a feature extractor for audio signals captured by an\\\\nin-ear microphone for the task of eating detection in a self-supervised way. We\\\\nbase our approach on the SimCLR method for image classification, proposed by\\\\nChen et al. from the domain of computer vision. Results are promising as our\\\\nself-supervised method achieves similar results to supervised training\\\\nalternatives, and its overall effectiveness is comparable to current\\\\nstate-of-the-art methods.

To solve this problem outside the acoustic domain, we focus on\\\\nhead-wearable devices, such as earbuds and virtual reality (VR) headsets, which\\\\nare feasible to continuously monitor the bone-conducted voice in the vibration\\\\ndomain. Specifically, we identify that air and bone conduction (AC/BC) from the\\\\nsame vocalization are coupled (or concurrent) and user-level unique, which\\\\nmakes them suitable behavior and biometric factors for multi-factor\\\\nauthentication (MFA). The legitimate user can defeat acoustic domain and even\\\\ncross-domain spoofing samples with the proposed two-stage AirBone\\\\nauthentication. The first stage answers \\\\\\\\textit{whether air and bone conduction\\\\nutterances are time domain consistent (TC)} and the second stage runs\\\\n\\\\\\\\textit{bone conduction speaker recognition (BC-SR)}. The security level is\\\\nhence increased for two reasons: (1) current acoustic attacks on smart voice\\\\nassistants cannot affect bone conduction, which is in the vibration domain; (2)\\\\neven for advanced cross-domain attacks, the unique bone conduction features can\\\\ndetect adversary\\'s impersonation and machine-induced vibration. Finally,\\\\nAirBone authentication has good usability (the same level as voice\\\\nauthentication) compared with traditional MFA and those specially designed to\\\\nenhance smart voice security. Our experimental results show that the proposed\\\\nAirBone authentication is usable and secure, and can be easily equipped by\\\\ncommercial off-the-shelf head wearables with good user experience.\", \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15203v1\\'}]', call_id='', is_error=False)], type='ToolCallExecutionEvent'), ToolCallSummaryMessage(source='ReporterGenerator', models_usage=None, content='[{\\'kind\\': \\'customsearch#result\\', \\'title\\': \\'Does headphone/earphone technology improve over the years like ...\\', \\'htmlTitle\\': \\'Does <b>headphone</b>/<b>earphone technology</b> improve over the <b>years</b> like ...\\', \\'link\\': \\'https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1h39utu/does_headphoneearphone_technology_improve_over/\\', \\'displayLink\\': \\'www.reddit.com\\', \\'snippet\\': \\'Nov 30, 2024 ... ... advancement than anything technological in the last 20-30 years. ...

The second experiment uses the phone sensors to\\\\nmeasure the magnet field produced by the small magnet found in the speaker of\\\\ncommon earbuds, or in-ear headphones. The students then carefully investigate\\\\nthe dependence of the magnitude of the field on the axial distance between the\\\\nspeaker magnet and the phone\\'s sensors. Using a ring magnet approximation,\\\\nadvanced Excel curve-fitting methods are introduced to determine the radius of\\\\nthe magnet in the earbud and the distance between the magnet\\'s location and the\\\\nexternal surface of the earbud housing.\", \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02258v1\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Self-Supervised Feature Learning of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks with Contrastive Loss for Eating Detection Using an In-Ear Microphone\\', \\'authors\\': [\\'Vasileios Papapanagiotou\\', \\'Christos Diou\\', \\'Anastasios Delopoulos\\'], \\'published\\': \\'2021-08-02\\', \\'abstract\\': \\'The importance of automated and objective monitoring of dietary behavior is\\\\nbecoming increasingly accepted.

To solve this problem outside the acoustic domain, we focus on\\\\nhead-wearable devices, such as earbuds and virtual reality (VR) headsets, which\\\\nare feasible to continuously monitor the bone-conducted voice in the vibration\\\\ndomain. Specifically, we identify that air and bone conduction (AC/BC) from the\\\\nsame vocalization are coupled (or concurrent) and user-level unique, which\\\\nmakes them suitable behavior and biometric factors for multi-factor\\\\nauthentication (MFA). The legitimate user can defeat acoustic domain and even\\\\ncross-domain spoofing samples with the proposed two-stage AirBone\\\\nauthentication. The first stage answers \\\\\\\\textit{whether air and bone conduction\\\\nutterances are time domain consistent (TC)} and the second stage runs\\\\n\\\\\\\\textit{bone conduction speaker recognition (BC-SR)}. The security level is\\\\nhence increased for two reasons: (1) current acoustic attacks on smart voice\\\\nassistants cannot affect bone conduction, which is in the vibration domain; (2)\\\\neven for advanced cross-domain attacks, the unique bone conduction features can\\\\ndetect adversary\\'s impersonation and machine-induced vibration. Finally,\\\\nAirBone authentication has good usability (the same level as voice\\\\nauthentication) compared with traditional MFA and those specially designed to\\\\nenhance smart voice security.

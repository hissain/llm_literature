The use of IMU sensors in conjunction with BCG, as investigated in [2], enhances accuracy and robustness.  Machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in improving the accuracy and reliability of HR estimation [3].  While promising, challenges remain, including individual variability in BCG and IMU signals and the need for robust algorithms to handle noisy data [4].  Future research directions include developing personalized models for HR detection [5].

    "        1. Implement functions for finding top 5 most relevant publications within recent years utilizing Python semanticscholar.\n",
    "        2. You may need to install Python modules i.e. semanticscholar usin bash pip as a pre-requisite step.\n",
    "           - Here is an example of how to search with semanticscholar:\n",
    "           ```from semanticscholar import SemanticScholar\n",
    "            sch = SemanticScholar()\n",
    "            search_results = sch.search_paper(query, limit=limit)\n",

    "            from semanticscholar for the given query.\n",
    "            - Make sure that the returned publications matches the topic.\n",
    "            - You many need to gradually expand the query if results are too small.\n",
    "            - You may need to make alternative implementation if many attempts dont solve same bug.\n",
    "        4. Remember, if there is a time consuming steps i.e. finding papers succeeds, you can store intermediate output in temporary file,\n",
    "            to save times in debugging later steps. Its because to fix a bug in later steps, re running previous steps if ineffective.\n",
    "        5. The final review document should look very professional and scientific. Links should be hyperlinked.\n",
    "        6. After retrieving, format your findings as a structured report with clear sections and paper summaries.\n",

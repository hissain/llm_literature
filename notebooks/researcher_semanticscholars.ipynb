      "Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using BCG and IMU sensors for HRV detection.  [1] explored the use of BCG for sleep apnea detection, showcasing the potential of BCG in capturing subtle physiological signals.  [2] proposed an algorithm for joint detection of heart rate and respiration rate.  Other works [3, 4] highlighted methods for extracting HRV features from BCG signals and validated their accuracy against reference ECG measurements. The integration of IMU data with BCG has also been investigated [5], with researchers exploring sensor fusion techniques to improve the robustness and accuracy of HRV estimation.  These combined approaches aim to leverage the complementary information provided by BCG and IMU sensors, leading to more reliable HRV measurements in real-world settings.  The research indicates promising advancements in the development of wearable and non-invasive HRV monitoring systems, paving the way for wider clinical and personal use.\n",

      "1. **Import Handling:** The code now uses a `try-except` block to gracefully handle the case where the necessary libraries are not installed. It prints a helpful error message guiding the user to install the missing package(s) using `pip`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exit Codes:**  The code now uses `sys.exit(1)` to exit with a non-zero exit code if the script encounters an error (missing library or no research papers found).  This is standard practice to signal that the script did not complete successfully.  `sys.exit(0)` (or simply omitting `sys.exit()`) indicates successful completion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Saving .md file:** The markdown content is saved to a `.md` file before converting to PDF.  This is helpful for reviewing the markdown directly and for having a backup.\n",
      "\n",
      "This revised version should work correctly in a standard Python environment. Please let me know if you encounter any further issues.\n",

Studies like [[1]](#1) investigate the use of IMUs to enhance the accuracy and robustness of BCG measurements by compensating for motion artifacts.  This approach allows for BCG signal acquisition in more dynamic settings, expanding its applicability to daily life activities.  Other works, such as [[2]](#2), delve into the potential of IMU data to improve heart rate estimation algorithms based on BCG signals. By incorporating information about body posture and movement, researchers aim to achieve more precise heart rate tracking even during periods of physical activity.  Moreover, the fusion of BCG and IMU data opens avenues for assessing other physiological parameters beyond heart rate. Some studies explore the feasibility of extracting respiratory information from the combined signals, as demonstrated in [[3]](#3).  The integration of BCG and IMU sensors into wearable devices is a key focus of research, enabling continuous and unobtrusive health monitoring [[4]](#4).  The development of advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques is crucial for extracting meaningful physiological insights from the combined BCG and IMU data [[5]](#5). Overall, the integration of BCG and IMU technologies holds significant promise for developing innovative healthcare solutions.\"\"\"\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Broader Search Query:** The search query is changed to  `Ballistocardiography OR IMU OR (Ballistocardiogram AND Accelerometer)`. This uses OR to find papers related to either technology and also tries a related term \"Accelerometer.\"  This is a more inclusive search strategy.  You can also use the commented-out `topic` which use AND operator and group multi word query for more specific result and to avoid any confussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Removed Restrictive Quotes:**  The `%22` quotes were removed from the query. While useful for exact phrase matching, they were too restrictive in this case.  The new query structure (using OR) handles this better.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Categories to List:** Changed `paper.categories` to `list(paper.categories)` to handle cases where `categories` might be a generator, preventing errors during PDF generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Reduced `max_results` (for Testing):**  Reduced to 5 for faster testing.  Increase it back to 20 (or higher) once you confirm the search is working.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these changes, the code is more likely to find relevant papers on arXiv and create the PDF report successfully.  Experiment with the search query further to refine the results if needed.\n",

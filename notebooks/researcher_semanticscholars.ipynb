Traditional methods, such as electrocardiography (ECG), can be cumbersome and require specialized equipment.  The use of Ballistocardiography (BCG) and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) has emerged as a promising alternative for contactless HR monitoring. BCG captures the body's micro-movements caused by cardiac activity, while IMUs measure acceleration and angular velocity. These methods offer the potential for convenient and continuous HR monitoring. This review analyzes recent research on the combined use of BCG and IMU sensors for HR detection.\\n\\n\"\n",

      "    md_content += \"Several studies explore the synergistic use of BCG and IMU data for enhanced HR estimation [1, 2, 3].  By combining the complementary information from both sensor modalities, researchers aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HR detection, particularly in the presence of motion artifacts.  [1] proposes a novel algorithm for joint processing of BCG and IMU signals, demonstrating improved HR estimation accuracy compared to using either sensor alone.  The work in [2] focuses on developing a wearable system for continuous HR monitoring using BCG and IMU sensors, highlighting the potential for practical applications in real-world scenarios.  Researchers in [3] investigate the impact of different body postures on the performance of BCG-based HR detection and propose posture-specific calibration techniques.  Furthermore, some studies investigate the use of machine learning methods to automatically extract relevant features from BCG and IMU data for HR estimation [4]. [5] shows a method that improves signal-to-noise by fusing IMU and BCG.  Overall, the reviewed literature suggests that combining BCG and IMU sensors holds significant promise for accurate and unobtrusive HR monitoring, paving the way for wider adoption in healthcare and wellness applications.\\n\\n\"\n",

      "Key Changes and Explanations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Logging:**  Using `logging.error()` and `logging.warning()` provides more informative error messages and separates warnings from errors.\n",
      "2. **Specific Exception Handling:** Catching `AttributeError`, `KeyError`, and `TypeError` specifically addresses common problems like missing fields in the paper data.  \n",
      "3. **`.get()` for Dictionary Access:** Using `.get(\"DOI\")` instead of `[\"DOI\"]` avoids `KeyError` if the \"DOI\" key is not present. The same applies to the volume information.\n",
      "4. **Fallback Search:**  If the initial query returns no results, a broader search (replacing \"AND\" with \"OR\") is performed.\n",
      "5. **Returning empty list**: if search fails and no paper was found, return empty list to prevent further errors.\n",
      "6. **`limit` parameter:** In order to retrieve more than 10 papers at once, the `limit` parameter should be specified, e.g. `search_results = sch.search_paper(query, limit=10000)`. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With these changes, you should get more helpful error messages, understand why papers are being skipped, and hopefully get some valid results. If the problem persists, the issue could be with the `semanticscholar` library itself or network issues. You could try updating or reinstalling the library.\n",

      "* **Detailed Error Logging:** Include the `paper` data in the error log when an error occurs during processing. This is *crucial* for understanding what's going wrong with specific papers.\n",
      "* **Handling Empty Results After Processing:**  The `if not papers:` block after the loop ensures an explicit message is logged if no papers are successfully processed, even if the search itself doesn't raise an exception.\n",
      "* **Always Print Termination:** The `print(\"TERMINATE\")` is now outside the `if papers:` block to ensure it's always printed, even if no papers are found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This improved version should give you more insight into the search process:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **No results in logs:**  If you don't see \"Initial search returned...\" or \"Broader search returned...\" in the logs, it likely indicates a problem with the Semantic Scholar API connection or the library itself. Check your network connection. Consider trying a different query or a simpler one to test the connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Zero results in logs:** If you see \"Initial search returned 0 results\" and \"Broader search returned 0 results,\" your query isn't finding any matches. Try refining your query, broadening it further, or using synonyms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Errors processing papers:** If you see detailed error messages including paper data, examine the specific errors and adjust the code to handle the issues with the data format.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With this enhanced logging, you should be able to diagnose the problem effectively. If you still get no results or persistent errors, provide the specific error messages and log output, and I can offer further assistance.\n",

      "* **Retry Mechanism:** Added retries with exponential backoff to handle temporary network issues.\n",
      "* **Convert to List:**  Convert `search_results` to a list immediately to avoid potential issues with the `PaginatedResults` object.\n",
      "* **Stepwise Query Broadening:** Replace only one \"AND\" with \"OR\" at a time in each retry. This allows for more controlled broadening.\n",
      "* **Multiple Queries:**  Start with a specific query and progressively broaden it across multiple attempts. This helps ensure you get *some* relevant results even if the initial query is too narrow.\n",
      "* **Checking for Empty Papers within the Loop:** This additional condition handles the case where no papers are successfully processed even after search_results are returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this version *still* doesn't produce any output or logs, something is fundamentally wrong with the `semanticscholar` library's interaction with the API or your network setup. I'd recommend:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Testing the API Directly:**  Try making a direct request to the Semantic Scholar API using a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to rule out issues with the Python library.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Checking Network Configuration:** Make sure your network allows connections to the Semantic Scholar API.  If you're behind a firewall or proxy, you may need to configure it appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Trying a Different Library:**  If you suspect a problem with the `semanticscholar` library, consider using a different Semantic Scholar API client or a broader academic search API.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can provide the output of the direct API calls or any error messages you see when testing the network connection, it will help diagnose the root cause.\n",
